## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Mechanical engineering student in the Cohen physics lab at Cornell university.
I work on projects with robots on the length scale of a hair.
Some of the publications that I have contributed to:

Liu, Q., Wang, W., Sinhmar, H. et al. Electronically configurable microscopic metasheet robots. Nat. Mater. 24, 109â€“115 (2025). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41563-024-02007-7:
Analyzed the curvatures and area expansions of experimental devices and simulated devices. Code can be found here: https://github.com/jtpelster/CurvatureExtractorMetamaterial

Currently working on papers about Bulk Electrochemical actuators, and Fiber-based robots.

If you have data that needs synchronization between a DAQ and a camera, look at this labview program I developed for use in the Cohen Lab electrochemical data collection setup:
